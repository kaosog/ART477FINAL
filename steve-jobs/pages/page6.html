  <P id = "schoolp1">Returning to the United States permanently, Kobe attended Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, where he immediately made an impact on the basketball team. His extraordinary talent was evident as he led his team to a state championship in his senior year, finishing his high school career with 2,883 points—surpassing Wilt Chamberlain's southeastern Pennsylvania record.</P>

He participated in community service initiatives through his high school and began to understand how his growing platform could be used to make a difference. His academic excellence matched his athletic prowess, demonstrating the balanced approach to success he would later advocate through his philanthropic work.</p>
