  <p id ="impactP2">Kobe Bryantâ€™s philanthropy endures through the Kobe and Vanessa Bryant Family Foundation, launched in 2007, which donated $1 million to the National Museum of African American History and Culture and raised $6.15 million via the Kobe China Fund for youth education and sports globally. His support for Kids in Sports Los Angeles ($20,000) and COACH for Kids ($75,000) bolstered underserved communities. These efforts, alongside his United Way partnerships, continue to fund scholarships and cultural programs, empowering at-risk youth with opportunities for growth.</p>
