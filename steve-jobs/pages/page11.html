His advocacy secured funding, ensuring these initiatives thrive post-2020, offering safe spaces for socio-emotional and physical development. This program remains a lifeline, providing thousands of underserved students with tools to succeed in school and life.</p>

Its co-ed Skills Academy camp, launched in 2021, promotes inclusivity and skill-building. By supporting young women and at-risk athletes, the foundation ensures equal sports access, continuing Kobe’s vision of community upliftment and opportunity for future generations.</p>
