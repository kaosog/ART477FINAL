<p id = "coverparagpraph"> Dedicated to Kobe Bryant—a legend whose impact reached far beyond the game of basketball. He inspired millions with his courage, determination, and relentless pursuit of greatness. Though he lived a life unlike most of us, his "Mamba Mentality" reminds us that with hard work and passion, we all have the power to rise above challenges. As a father and mentor, Kobe led with love, wisdom, and strength. Even if we aren’t parents, we can still carry his lessons into our own lives—striving to be better, to lift others, and to leave a legacy worth remembering.</p>
