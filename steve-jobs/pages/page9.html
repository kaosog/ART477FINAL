  <p id = "careerP1">Beyond individual accolades, Bryant’s impact shone in critical moments. He secured two Finals MVP awards (2009, 2010), leading the Lakers past Orlando and Boston with averages of 32.4 and 28.6 points, respectively. A 15-time All-NBA selection and 12-time All-Defensive honoree, he balanced scoring with tenacious defense, often guarding the opponent’s best player. His 33,643 career points rank fourth all-time, a testament to his consistency across 1,346 games, even through injuries like a torn Achilles in 2013.</p>
  <p id = "careerP2">Bryant’s influence extended to his work ethic, dubbed the "Mamba Mentality." He won two Olympic gold medals (2008, 2012), contributing to Team USA’s global dominance. His Oscar-winning short film Dear Basketball capped a career that transcended sports, but his four NBA All-Star Game MVP awards and back-to-back scoring titles (2006, 2007) cemented his on-court legend. Retiring in 2016 after a 60-point farewell game, Kobe left an indelible mark as one of basketball’s greatest competitors.</p>
